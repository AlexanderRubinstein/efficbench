**Use our methods/tools:** If you are interested in using our methods/tools, please check the [tinyBenchmarks GitHub repository](https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/tinyBenchmarks) instead.

**Use our datasets from the paper:** If you are interested in using the datasets we used in this work, please find them in the "data" folder. They are all in ".pickle" format and can easily be loaded into Python. If you want to check the code used to generate/process the datasets, please check the "generating_data" folder.

**Running our code:** 
  - Install `requirements.txt` with `pip` and our version of `py-IRT` (please check [here](https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/py-irt)).
  - Please run our main experiments using the "run_experiment.py" file. You will need to pass some parameters to the script.
